                            <p> I realize this is asking a lot, but hoping someone would do me the favor. My horn sounds terribly faint. I used a free app on my iPhone called Decibel X (not an endorsement, but consistency would help). Here is a pic to show the setup (https://imgur.com/a/ioG79e0) So I came up with 82.1 Db in my sheetrock garage. When I drive down the road I can barely hear it over the noise. Thanks to anyone who is able to help.you guys are the best. In case it matters I was driving a big rig with civilian plates across town to my friends shop so it can be broken down and overhauled. The truck has a rev limiter so it tops out at 60 mph and the highway speed here is 65 so obviously its a right laner. I was pretty much cruising at max speed coming up on a interchange, traffic was light so i had no problems all night until this interchange came up. in my mirror i saw a fast moving set of lights headed behind me, then to my left, then directly in front - In the beginning, Captain Marvel saves Iron Man. Of course she does. - They decide to find Thanos. Iron Man says paraphrased "see, captain america, you're an idiot. because of you we have no surveillance net to detect thanos". Means: They can't detect where he is. - Nebula says: Oi, I can tell you where he is. He's in his garden. - She doesn't say on which planet. - Rocket runs a 2 second scan on his computer and says "Oi, we found an energetic signature similar Passed my CBT last year early November, got a CB125F end of November. Idea was to use the cheap little 125 as a low cost commute, maybe do my CBT a second time two years later get 4 years out of it. That was the idea. instead I done my full test in August, traded in my CB125F for the CB500F and turned my cheaper commute into a grand yearly total of £7,002 (not inc. fuel costs). Better keep that page of my budget hidden from the wife a few years longer til the costs even themselves You know your story is a tough one when a trained and experience psychologist of 20+ years has to ask you "How are you still alive?" Well I got that reaction. I'm not going to go into my full sad past. Let's just sum it up as brief as possible so I can get to the meat of it all. Raised in a broken home. Raised by my mother and grandmother mainly. An older brother with a god complex who tortured me daily on every level but sexually and my step dad took care of that once as well as a summer school. I'm selling my car and looking at options. Trademe Motors seems to be dominated by car yard listings so wondering if it's actually worth paying the listing. 
I've had my fair share of run ins with car yards, some good some bad. But it wasn't until I was hired as a sales rep for a second hand car yard that I realised the stereotype for stingy con salesman thing was real. Except the yards and cars looked nicer, the place had a pretty good office and everyone wore suits. amp#x200B; I spent the first few days washing cars which was fine, but when I started to learn how to take the cars out, take photos, and put them up for sale, I was told and taught. Sorry, LTL, FTP. Formatting is probably a mess. Just needed to get this out before I self combust. I've been with my fiancé for a few years. We have DD, 3 and DS, 1 in a few days. FDH (fiancé) is my rock and is pretty much my caregiver when my chronic illness flares up. He's amazing and incredibly resilient to take care of me, our child together and my child from a previous relationship who lives with us part time. Well, according to MIL, I'm every terrible thing in the book. Hi everyone, amp#x200B; So lately, I have come across numerous different types of Mechanical Warranties sold by dealers at car yards (E.g. Janssen + Autosure - also with different types of cover etc.). So I have asked around and managed to get a ballpark figure on the recommended retail price that dealers should sell the warranties to buyers however, I do understand that they have the ability to go lower or higher than the RRP. My question is, does anyone 
If anyone’s selling an older car 1970-1990 please pm me or if you know of any car yards that have some older cars please let me know. Not sure if this is the right place but if someone could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated. Hi everyone, first time applying for a sales consultant role in Australia Is it considered normal/reccomended to go in to the place of work (retail and car yards) and hand in a resume/cover letter if you've already applied for the role via seek? Asked on alt as people on my main know the account from work and they've also asked questions I have an assignment coming up and am looking for interesting locations around Wagga Wagga if anyone has any spots to recommend. I'm after scrap yards or old car yards, places with old buildings, forgotten about projects or items. Just places in the middle of nowhere that there has been human impact. Thanks. Hey guys, I'm new to Canada. I have recently put a down deposit for a car. I'm going into ICBC to swap my Australian licence for a Canadian one and also going to pay for my car that day. Its from a smaller car yard and was wondering if I need to go to ICBC to get any paperwork for the car to be put in my name with plates or is it done at the car dealership. How does insurance Through some magical, space time, villain communication channel, they find a way to congregate to join forces against Daniel. We know Tom Cole has been active behind the scene this season, it wouldn't surprise me if it culminated into something big next season. Attacking Daniel both in the car-yard and the dojo, forcing him to seek outside. I know what you're going to say, "you're a fuckwit." Truth was this was before I discovered TRP. A bit of context: I have inherited close to  million from my late grandmother and since my plate and I were good friends, she knew about this. Next thing you know her car dies, and she sees her dream car for sale in a car yard. She needs a k deposit, and I loan it to her. Because that was relatively easy for her, and the fact she knew I had cash savings PLUS a good job, it seemed like every. </p>
