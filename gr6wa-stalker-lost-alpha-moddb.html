I've been playing Lost alpha all day now. sadly i find it a bit lackluster as Clear Sky is one of my absolute favorites, do you guys have any amazing recommended mods for CS that i should grab? (( Going to try out COP with misery)) (never liked COP because it feels like all the maps are just one big bowl). S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lost Alpha early access version has been released. Dear Stalkers, welcome Hey, mates. Im here to see if I can get some help. Ive managed to get a free car from Darkscape in LA, a moskovich, but I cannot access to its trunk or refuel it.

Hello evrybody. Im just a noob on all of this modding world, so I do not know where I must post this answer, I am sorry if I get wrong. One year ago I tried to mod the S.T.A.L.K.E.R Lost Alpha 1.3003 for myself reading a lot of tutorials of how to mod the stalker files, anyways, all modification. Oh boy where do I begin? First of all, I've followed the mod's development for what seems like ages. I think i've been there from the very beginning. I visited the ModDB page numerous times a day to see what's new, always being excited when there actually was something new. I did monthly marathons of looking at all the screenshots and trailers too. I was a VERY big fan of it. I was always worried with the prospect of being disappointed with it when it was finally released, but I always It was so very many nightmares ago. It was a set of daytime urban maps with Freeman running through maybe 5 sections. One of the oddities was it had apartments that rose up 4-5 stories in one area. Will try to remember more. BTW - STALKER - Lost Alpha (https://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha) is free to download and play. 6GB split into 4 parts.

There's a lot of mods for all three stalker games out there, and it can be a little confusing when looking into mods for the first time to lose sight of what each of them does exactly, so to explain I made a little overview for anyone who's left confused about it all These mods are bugfixes only , they don't enhance graphics or gameplay like the other mods do: The Zone Reclamation Project ( (SoC) Sky Reclamation Project (http://www.moddb.com/mods.

Stalker mods have really let the game grow over the years despite the developer's lack of presence. The mods that have come out of the scene have ranged from bug fixes to complete overhauls. In this post I'll list off mods I've either A) Played or B) Heard excellent things about. A bit of a warning: MOST MODS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER! Vanilla Stalker is buggy, some mods make it buggier. Prepare yourself for crashes and remind yourself to keep calm and cheeki breeki. Here is the long awaited third patch for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Lost Alpha. Due to the changes in storyline and engine, it's required to start a new game after you installed this update. Your previous saves made with 1.3002 will not work. This patch is cumulative. I was looking at cancelled modding projects for the Stalker games - Zone of the Homeless, Wormwood etc.- and recalled there being a mod called something along the lines of "Path to the Zone" in developemnt for ShoC. I must have first stumbled upon it in the Summer of 2013 on ModDB. It looked really ambitious, I especially remember that usable PC's were supposed to be a big feature (I guess like in Lost Alpha). Graphics were also really good. The mod then ceased updating in either Discuss the topic "STALKER Lost Alpha" in the Tech Support Official Forums.

Well, after several bugs, reinstallations and problems (PSA: DON'T install Call of Pripyat Remake Mod, I'll write a post on its own on why), I finally beaten Call of Pripyat. Now, I want to explore a bit more Pripyat, go back to get some unfinished business done, beat the shit out of the Zaton mercs and the Major will be able to actually rest. Anyway, the Major can rest, but I want more. I've been lurking around and a bit of moddb, and I should ask, which should be my next step? Recommendation.

Hello Gents and Ladies, I was wondering if this here place would be right for me to ask of you to recommend me some mods and perhaps addons for those mods I've got all STALKER games installed and while I play Clear Sky very rarely, I play the other two quite a lot. I am mostly looking for mods that focus on gunplay. Scarce ammo, great weapon anims (reload), more centered weaponry, tons of new guns to play with, AI enhancements(more lively instead of scripted/static like vanilla) We are urgently looking for designers, who can help to fill the empty spaces in our game world. skills needed: - you should like the stalker world - you should be familiar with xray sdk (adding gulags, smart terrains, scripted events) - you should be familiar with LUA scripting - be friendly. Hey yall! I'm a complete newbie to the world of mods for STALKER, and i know there's a hell of a lot of them. However, from what information I can gather, there's a lot of features that occasionally overlap between them, but I'm having a hard time really understand which mods are complete overhauls, which are minor graphics changes, which ones are just better versions of others, and all that sort of stuff. I went through several links for "best mods for stalker" on google, and basically Lost Alpha — глобальная модификация  опубликованного на английском языке на moddb.  Сюжет Lost Alpha. В целом, сюжет S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lost Alpha — это другой взгляд на сюжет S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Not the old texture replacement mod, but the all-new vegetation models from CrommCruac, last released for CoP in Absolute Nature 4: Video: Ancient vegetation models straight out of 2003 (seriously, that's when majority of them were authored, check the older SoC builds) are the worst part of Stalker visually, so it would

I have Lost Alpha ready to be installed as well as the latest patch I could find (1.3) but I went and read the reviews over on the ModDB page and good god people do not sound impressed, just wanting to get advice from my fellow stalkers on the sub, should I or should I not install and play Lost Alpha, I have a fairly beefy system and believe me, my patience for bugs is high ever since I installed that trainwreck excuse for "Complete Форум s.t.a.l.k.e.r - модификации, аддоны, дополнения, оптимизация, софт, программы, патчи, фиксы. So, I've gotten into Lost Alpha, but wanted more diversity in the weapons. So, I downloaded the mod pack on moddb that added in more. However, the weapon damages seem wayyy too high.as in, instant death from pistols at long range. It's the same issue that was discussed here: https://www.reddit (dot) com/r/stalker/comments/32dexv/lost_alpha_weapons_are_doing_way_too_much_damage/ I was going to go through the config files myself, but I don't know what damages I need to base the weapons 
Moddb: http://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha/downloads/stalker-lost-alpha-sdk-ad. I've not dabbled much with STALKER modding but the recent release of Lost Alpha drew me into trying to understand how the base engine works. From what I've seen of Lost Alpha and announcment in OGSE0.6.9.3 ( the base game executable looks different from the original SoC executable, with support for FXAA/SMAA, DX10, and things like Ambient Occlusion. Does anyone know if they're simply taking the exe from CoP/CS. This is honestly the most garbage game ive ever played. all the game breaking bugs and terrible design flaws and vague storyline and destroyed by the total redo and reworking of the whole game halfway through BUT for some reason I love this game and im not alone Lost alpha is vanilla stalker. Lost Alpha is a re-imagining of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl game, adding content that was cut from early videos and screens of the game. The mod is released as a full standalone with GSC Game World's blessing; you don't need the original game to play this. I know everyone's trying to nab up Watch_Dogs keys, but if you enjoy FPS/RPG games, you owe it to yourself if you haven't played a STALKER game before. edit: smrat ppl add links — Скачать отдельно: moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha/addons/stalker-lost-alpha-ost • АРХИВ (все старые версии, доп. мат. и другое): — Яндекс.Диск: vk.cc/2xi3hi  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. «Логово.

I've just finished SoC Complete on stalker difficulty, some parts were ridiculously hard and I'd get sniped by guys I couldn't even see.
